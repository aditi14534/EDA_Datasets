 EDA_Datasets
 Data Analysis and Machine learning on multiple datasets
 Project Overview
 This project involves data analysis and machine learning applied to five different datasets. The goal is to extract insights, preprocess data,
 and build predictive models.

 Datasets
 The analysis is performed on the following datasets:
 1. House Price Prediction
 2. World Happiness Report
 3. Flight Prices Prediction
 4. Traffic accident Prediction
 5. Credit Card Fraud Detection

 Machine Learning Models
 The following machine learning techniques have been applied:
 Linear Regression
 XGBRegressor
 RandomForestClassifier
 LogisticRegression
 RandomForestRegressor
 mean_squared_error, r2_score

 How To Use
 Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/aditi14534/EDA_Datasets.git
 Navigate to the repository: cd EDA-Datasets
 Open and run the Jupyter Notebook and google colab notebook on each dataset to explore the analysis.
